This repo is based on the tutorials, blog, and repos

The images are found online

Since this repo is heavily depends on the library dlib, and it is not supported on my machine, I have run the codes on google colab. All files needed and uotput files are there. 

The img2gif.py is for convert the output image series to gif the results are:

![facemorph1](facemorph1.gif)

![facemorph2](facemorph2.gif)

![facemorph3](facemorph3.gif)
